# ResNet18 Image Classification with Synthetic Flower Dataset

## Project Overview
This project implements and validates a ResNet18-based image classification model using an automatically generated synthetic flower dataset. The goal is to demonstrate a complete deep learning pipeline without relying on external real-world datasets.

## Features
- Automatic generation of synthetic flower images (roses, tulips, daisies)
- ResNet18 model implementation with ImageNet pre-trained weights
- Complete training, validation, and evaluation pipeline
- Comprehensive visualization of training metrics
- Easy-to-use scripts for reproduction and experimentation
